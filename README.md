## Welcome

Welcome to **Build With Tarlee**. We’re genuinely glad you’re here.

If you joined this space, it likely means you’re curious about building real things with technology—not just watching tutorials or memorizing syntax without understanding how everything fits together. That curiosity is the foundation of this community.

Build With Tarlee exists for people who want learning to feel **practical, grounded, and connected to real-world problems**. This is not a spectator sport. You’re here to build.

---

## What Is Build With Tarlee?

Build With Tarlee is a **hands-on learning community** built around a simple belief:

> You learn best when you’re actually building.

Instead of separating theory from practice, we merge them. Every concept you encounter exists for a reason and is applied to something tangible.

You won’t just learn *how* code works.  
You’ll understand *why* it works—and how to use it outside of tutorials to solve real problems.

---

## How This Space Works

Learning here happens through **missions**.

Each mission focuses on solving a real problem by building a real project. As you work through these projects, you’ll naturally learn:

- Programming fundamentals  
- How systems are designed  
- How different technologies fit together  
- How to think like a builder, not just a coder  

There’s no pressure to be perfect. Progress beats polish.  
Clarity beats speed. Confidence comes from repetition.

## Who This Space Is For

This space is for:

- Beginners looking for a clear, practical entry into tech  
- Self-taught developers stuck in tutorial loops  
- Builders who want structure, guidance, and accountability  
- Anyone who wants to create useful things—not just “learn tech” in isolation  

You don’t need to know everything to belong here.  
You just need to be willing to learn, try, and keep showing up.

## What You’ll Get From This Community

- Clear guidance while working on real projects

That’s how real skill is formed.

Welcome to **Build With Tarlee**.  
Let’s build together.
