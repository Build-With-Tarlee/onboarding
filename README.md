## Welcome

Welcome to **Build With Tarlee**. We’re really glad you’re here. If you’ve joined this space, it likely means you’re curious about building real things with technology, not just watching tutorials or memorizing syntax without knowing how everything fits together. That curiosity is exactly what this community is built for.

Build With Tarlee was created for people who want to learn by doing, grow practical skills, and develop the confidence to solve real-world problems using tech. This is a space where learning feels grounded, useful, and connected to reality.

## What Is Build With Tarlee?

Build With Tarlee is a hands-on learning community built around a simple belief: you learn best when you’re actually building. Instead of separating theory from practice, we bring them together. Every concept you encounter here exists for a reason and will be applied to something tangible.

You won’t just learn how code works, you’ll understand **why** it works and how to use it to build real solutions outside of tutorials.

---

## How This Space Works

Learning in this community happens through **missions**. Each mission focuses on solving a real problem by building a real project.

As we work through these projects, you’ll naturally learn programming fundamentals, how systems are designed, how different technologies fit together, and how to think through problems like a builder rather than just a coder.

There’s no pressure to be perfect here. The goal is steady progress, clarity, and growing confidence.

## Who This Space Is For

This space is for:
- Beginners looking for a clear and practical way into tech  
- Self-taught developers who feel stuck in tutorial loops  
- Builders who want guidance, structure, and accountability  
- Anyone who wants to create useful things instead of learning tech in isolation  

You don’t need to know everything to belong here. All that’s required is a willingness to learn, try, and keep showing up.
